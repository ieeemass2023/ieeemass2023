                <h5><b>Abstract:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Edge computing provides a new way to implement services with many unique advantages. While many edge computing solutions have been implemented within different network infrastructures, in this talk, we will explore the "roaming" edge of the Internet --- in vehicles -- where computing services are increasingly important, and appropriate edge capabilities need to be rolled out. We will describe how this roaming edge can be used to scale diverse applications.</p>

                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Time: 2-3pm,  Monday, Sept. 25, 2023</p>

                <h5><b>Abstract:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The future security environment envisioned in emerging national defense concepts is characterized by the proliferation of unmanned, autonomous, and intelligent systems across all domains and echelons of command. Just as the explosion of intelligent devices designed to automate various aspects of civilian life has given rise to the commercial Internet of Things (IoT), the complex ecosystem of sensors and actuators that will accomplish tasks ranging from intelligence collection to autonomous logistics represents the evolution towards the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT). Fifth generation (5G) and future generation (FutureG) mobile wireless networks provide the capability necessary to support the IoBT across joint, allied, and partnered forces. In addition to the high throughput, low latency, and high device density, 5G/FutureG networks offer spectral agility, interoperability, improved security, containerized deployment, and integrated intelligence through innovative approaches such as Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN). This presentation will explore the ways in which 5G/FutureG capabilities support emerging national defense concepts and enable joint, allied, and partnered forces to cooperatively sense, make sense, and act.</p>
                <h5><b>Bio:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel entered the Marine Corps in May 2007 through the United States Naval Academy. 
                    Upon completion of The Basic School and the Basic Communications Officer Course, he reported to Headquarters and Service Company, 7th Marine Regiment 
                    in Twentynine Palms, California in June 2008 where he served as the Communications Platoon Commander, deploying to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 
                    support of Operation Enduring Freedom from October 2009 to October 2010.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In March of 2011, he departed 7th Marines for the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California after being selected 
                    for the Special Education Program. He graduated with distinction in June 2013, earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and an academic 
                    certificate in cyber warfare. Subsequently, he was assigned to the Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Virginia where he joined the Expeditionary 
                    Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism Department, serving as the Deputy Program Manager, and Program Manager (acting) of the Command & Control, 
                    Communications, Computers (C4) and Cyber Program.</p>

                    Doctor of Philosophy Technical Program. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Information Sciences in June 2022. Following his graduation, Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel 
                    reported to the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration in Quantico, Virginia where he joined the Force Design Research Group. He is currently 
                    on a temporary assignment to the FutureG Office in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering where he serves as the Marine Corps 
                    Lead for Warfighter Engagement and leads the Camp Pendleton 5G experiment for Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel’s military education includes non-resident Expeditionary Warfare School, the College of Naval Command Staff,

                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Time: 8:45-9:45am, Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Session Chair: Yu Wang, Temple University</p>
                <h5><b>Abstract:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, 3D human activity recognition (HAR) has become an important topic in human-computer interaction (HCI). 
                    It is a more challenging problem than classification, and is the enabler of many HCI applications. To preserve the privacy of users, there is considerable 
                    interest in techniques without using a video camera. To this end, RFID tags, as a low-cost wearable sensor, provide an effective solution for 3D human 
                    pose tracking. In this talk, we first present RFID-Pose, a vision-aided realtime 3D human pose estimation system based on deep learning. The system 
                    estimates the spatial rotation angle of each human limb, and utilizes the rotation angles to reconstruct human pose in realtime with the forward 
                    kinematic technique. The second part of this talk addresses the generalization problem, when a well-trained system is applied to a new environment. 
                    Meta-learning, as an effective technique to improve the model adaptability, is leveraged as a promising solution to the generalization problem. 
                    In addition, we present a technology-agnostic approach for RF-based human activity recognition (HAR), termed TARF, which generalizes a trained model 
                    to different RF sensing technologies in different frequency bands. With TARF, the cost and the barrier of wide deployment can both be greatly reduced, 
                    and more robust performance can be achieved by utilizing the complementary RF sensory data. Finally, in order to mitigate the cost of collecting training data, 
                    we propose a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named RFPose-GAN, to generate synthesized RFID data. Our experiments 
                    demonstrate that the synthesized data is useful for training the RFID-Pose model to achieve high pose estimation performance.</p>
