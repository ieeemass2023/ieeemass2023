                <h5><b>Bio:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel entered the Marine Corps in May 2007 through the United States Naval Academy. 
                    Upon completion of The Basic School and the Basic Communications Officer Course, he reported to Headquarters and Service Company, 7th Marine Regiment 
                    in Twentynine Palms, California in June 2008 where he served as the Communications Platoon Commander, deploying to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in 
                    support of Operation Enduring Freedom from October 2009 to October 2010.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In March of 2011, he departed 7th Marines for the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California after being selected 
                    for the Special Education Program. He graduated with distinction in June 2013, earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and an academic 
                    certificate in cyber warfare. Subsequently, he was assigned to the Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Virginia where he joined the Expeditionary 
                    Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism Department, serving as the Deputy Program Manager, and Program Manager (acting) of the Command & Control, 
                    Communications, Computers (C4) and Cyber Program.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In June 2016, Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel reported to Marine Wing Headquarters Squadron 1, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa, 
                    Japan where he served as the Network Operations Officer and the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff G-6. In July 2018, he was reassigned to III Marine Expeditionary 
                    Force (MEF) after being selected to serve as Aide-de-Camp to the III MEF Commanding General.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In July 2019, Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel returned to the Naval Postgraduate School after his selection for the Marine Corps 
                    Doctor of Philosophy Technical Program. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Information Sciences in June 2022. Following his graduation, Lieutenant Colonel Pimentel 
                    reported to the Deputy Commandant for Combat Development and Integration in Quantico, Virginia where he joined the Force Design Research Group. He is currently 
                    on a temporary assignment to the FutureG Office in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering where he serves as the Marine Corps 
                    Lead for Warfighter Engagement and leads the Camp Pendleton 5G experiment for Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Lieutenant Colonel Pimentelâ€™s military education includes non-resident Expeditionary Warfare School, the College of Naval Command Staff, 
                    and the Joint Cyberspace Operational Planners Course. His personal awards include the Meritorious Service Medal and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with gold star.</p>

                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Time: 8:45-9:45am, Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(178, 7, 7);font-weight: bold;">Session Chair: Yu Wang, Temple University</p>
                <h5><b>Abstract:</b></h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, 3D human activity recognition (HAR) has become an important topic in human-computer interaction (HCI). 
                    It is a more challenging problem than classification, and is the enabler of many HCI applications. To preserve the privacy of users, there is considerable 
                    interest in techniques without using a video camera. To this end, RFID tags, as a low-cost wearable sensor, provide an effective solution for 3D human 
                    pose tracking. In this talk, we first present RFID-Pose, a vision-aided realtime 3D human pose estimation system based on deep learning. The system 
                    estimates the spatial rotation angle of each human limb, and utilizes the rotation angles to reconstruct human pose in realtime with the forward 
                    kinematic technique. The second part of this talk addresses the generalization problem, when a well-trained system is applied to a new environment. 
                    Meta-learning, as an effective technique to improve the model adaptability, is leveraged as a promising solution to the generalization problem. 
                    In addition, we present a technology-agnostic approach for RF-based human activity recognition (HAR), termed TARF, which generalizes a trained model 
                    to different RF sensing technologies in different frequency bands. With TARF, the cost and the barrier of wide deployment can both be greatly reduced, 
                    and more robust performance can be achieved by utilizing the complementary RF sensory data. Finally, in order to mitigate the cost of collecting training data, 
                    we propose a data augmentation method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named RFPose-GAN, to generate synthesized RFID data. Our experiments 
                    demonstrate that the synthesized data is useful for training the RFID-Pose model to achieve high pose estimation performance.</p>
